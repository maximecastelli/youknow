<p style="text-indent:0em">The idea that everyone could become a contributor of journalistic content is not so far-fetched. Some (like the BBC) hope that it could expand media coverage and improve its accuracy. The new meta-profession of ‘citizen journalism’ was born from the aforementioned concept of user-generated content (UGC), a method sometimes applauded (à la wikipedia) and also derided (à la facebook). As a simple concept it is of course not so new in the media, from letters to the editor in the 19th century, game shows in the 20th and reality TV in the early 21st, but it may finally be at the point of becoming viable for the production of news reports. The BBC’s creation of a UGC team in 2005 following the London bombings is perhaps the first <span class="text-note" data-note="12">serious example</span>.</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em">An editor from BBC News Lab told me that “in an ideal world there would always be a reporter next to where the <span class="text-note" data-note="13">information happens.”</span> The idea of having journalists everywhere is essentially what the concept of ‘citizen journalism’ proposes, and is being facilitated by the decrease in size and cost of electronic news gathering (ENG) equipment. Most professional reporters currently use what is called a portable single camera (PSC) setup which involves a camcorder, tripod, radio mics and lights. In order to remotely send footage back to the newsrooms, the camera person carries a transmitter inside their backpack connected to mobile networks - and this is about as portable as it gets. At the citizen extreme, adaptive software is now offsetting the hardware limitations inherent in the size of smartphones, with near-instant video stabilisation and filters that produce new forms of video realism that may not look professional, but it may be good enough to precede new standards of viewing.</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em">Citizen journalism comes with large ethical and legal questions surrounding ownership, privacy and accuracy. If we imagine a society where everyone is constantly filming their daily lives (not dissimilar to what we already have), then an overload of non-consenting protagonists would figure in the back, middle and foreground of most footage with an urban backdrop.</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em">In the UK, current laws do not stop you filming others around you, and police officers officially have no power to stop you filming them, though can be quick to quote the <span class="text-note" data-note="14">terror act</span>. Overall, legislation and enforcement are quite arbitrary and often subject to case-by-case consideration in highly localised jurisdictions. For example, public space protection orders (PSPOs) enable local authorities to police ‘anti-social behaviours’ as an extra layer of criminality on national codes - see Salford Quays’ ban on people from <span class="text-note" data-note="15">swearing in public</span>. ‘Public space’ can also be privately owned, most notably in the case of malls and transport hubs which enforce bans on filming with spatial control orders drawn up by landowners and private security companies with the consent of local authorities.</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em">More to the point: In the world of citizen journalism, does the old distinction between public and private space even survive? If “technically, all of Britain is <span class="text-note" data-note="16">owned by somebody</span>” the subjectivity and power structures beyond the title plan are not the lines but the texture of a map, and each citizen journalist is subject to different constraints on their access to space depending on who they are and when they are. Furthermore, a citizen journalist is within their rights to film an event inside ‘their own’ private space, as a decade of UGC cat videos and karaoke covers spilling out of the suburbs will attest.</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em">At the very least, the planimetric model of public and private as drawn by planners and architects has to be jettisoned. Cinematic space is defined by criss-crossing linear projections and cones, distorted perspectives, montage and layering; and the plot, wall and window in as defined in a static drawing will no longer suffice. In citizen journalism, ‘the angle’ becomes more literal than metaphorical in the delivery of a news report as it carves out volumes of gradated privacy in urban space. Angle becomes pluralised as ‘angles’, and the city becomes the set of a rolling incidental cinema.
UGC also has to negotiate another form of ownership space - that of intellectual property (IP) and copyright. <span class="text-note" data-note="17">Youtube Terms and Conditions</span> state that: 
<blockquote>You agree that content you submit to the service will not contain any third party copyright material, or material that is subject to other third party proprietary rights (including rights of privacy or rights of publicity), unless you have a formal licence or permission from the rightful owner, or are otherwise legally entitled, to post the material in question.</blockquote> 
<p style="text-indent:2em">In the wording the entire responsibility and risks of ownership are concentrated on the contributor. However, the Zuck himself admitted in front of the US Congress themselves that Facebook is also in large part responsible for moderating <span class="text-note" data-note="18">offending content</span>.</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em">The European Union Copyright Directive has recently approved a new copyright reform forcing UGC platforms to implement a filter that checks user contributions and censors the ones with known copyrighted works embedded <span class="text-note" data-note="19">in their code</span>. In some cases, this is already being sorted and detected by algorithms in real time during upload: Relatively simple software can ‘recognise’ content, provided that it can match to an extensive existing database, which is often digitised audio.</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em">The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is concerned that the automation of UGC filtering will increase the wrongful blocking of <span class="text-note" data-note="20">non-infringing content</span>. They have even taken part in the defense of the <span class="text-note" data-note="21">“dancing baby video”</span>, citing free speech. Basically, a mother films her baby dancing to music for which she didn’t own the property rights, and the video is quickly removed by Youtube after receiving a copyright complaint from Universal. In cases like this one, the control of copyrighted material is still being done through human content moderators dealing with content flagged individually, putting more faith in the flesh than circuit boards.</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em">Either way, the scale and ubiquity of platform content control systems can make it very tempting to look for the exit. The infrastructure to opt out of having an online presence entirely is already being tested, legally and pragmatically, in what the EU is calling the <span class="text-note" data-note="22">‘right to erasure’</span>. It allows EU citizens to request personal information be removed from view by erasing the content itself from servers or from search engines indexes. Notwithstanding the problematic technical question of how it is possible to <span class="text-note" data-note="23">‘delete something from the internet’</span>, the act can’t be applied in any case to ‘content of public interest’, as it would confront the <span class="text-note" data-note="24">Freedom of Information Act</span>. The BBC has published a full list of stories that have been removed in order to keep <span class="text-note" data-note="25">“an idea about what's being delisted”</span>. Transparency and privacy are still being treated as conceptually opposing forces, but this may not be the case.</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em">Privacy laws perhaps need to distinguish between recording and streaming, as the former is not necessarily occuring during the latter. In China Miéville’s para-fictional novel “The City and the City”, two halves of a city inhabit the same space but half of the citizens are not allowed to look at the city that they are not part of. It is a story of social division so complete that it literally pervades photographic space. Back IRL, no one can yet be sanctioned for the act of looking at something, but they can be for the storage (i.e. ‘possession’) and transmission of certain data. The production and trade of ephemeral images seems to be embedded in codes of law but the viewing of it is not, a potential loophole that might be of much interest to future news.</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em">Many argue that despite the flexibility of the law, unsolicited filming represents breaches of privacy in a practical and ethical sense. Ultimately and especially in the UK, China and elsewhere, hyper-surveillance is already in place, and whether the camera is held by an arm made of flesh or an arm made of steel is largely academic, except that you can argue with the fleshy arm in real time as it pans. See <span class="text-note" data-note="26">Surveillance Camera Man</span> on vimeo for a perfect illustration of possible arguments.</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em">The process of gathering data by filming in its most pure form is physically harmless, unless the threats from unwilling subjects are rendered unto the camera operator. The interpretation and usage of collected data can be anything but harmless, which we know intuitively as ‘exposure’, in law as ‘evidence’ and in politics as ‘leverage’. As sheer volumes of footage mount up though, overexposure can also amount to a <span class="text-note" data-note="27">new sort of hiding</span>, evidence can be fabricated and applying leverage can backfire. As James Bridle puts it: “We know more and more about the world while being less and less able <span class="text-note" data-note="28">to do anything about it</span>”. We compulsively film our lives anyway without much knowing what to do with it, and we believe that we must employ the over-documentation of our bodies and habitats as a potential public asset rather than as hoarded ammunition.</p>
