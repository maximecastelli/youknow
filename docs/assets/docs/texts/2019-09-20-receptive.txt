<p style="text-indent:0em">If I am not interested in sports, why should I see the ‘Sport’ button on the BBC’s home page? The BBC is working on various projects to tailor content around users by first <span class="text-note" data-note="81">sequencing it</span> then <span class="text-note" data-note="82">re-organising it</span>. This allows “the content of programmes to change according to the requirements of each individual <span class="text-note" data-note="83">audience member”</span>. The idea is to provide a bespoke content feed in order to reduce the anxiety of what Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein call the <span class="text-note" data-note="84">‘choice overload’.</span></p>
<p style="text-indent:2em">Raymond Loewy’s 1929 Duplicator was a printer with a case limiting access to certain interactions with the product so that the user would not become confused by extraneous functions. The case was a cold hard steel beginning to what we would now call User Experience (UX) Design. We all agree that machines should do more and be seen less. They should not make our lives more complicated. ‘User friendliness’ in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) demands fluid experiences that feels more like traversing a meandering path than encountering a series of gates (no pun intended). The automation of leisure is the logical and just as expansive companion to the automation of labour.</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em">The current ‘choice architecture’ that the BBC is looking at takes advantage of the basic ML skillset of predicting behaviours and preferences based on biometric characteristics that it has learned to ‘read’. Baidu and KFC’s amusing experiment with facial recognition predicts what their Beijing financial district customers would like to eat based on their age, gender and mood that displays <span class="text-note" data-note="85">in their face</span>. Baidu’s press release uses the example of “a male customer in his early 20s”, who would be offered “a set meal of crispy chicken hamburger, roasted chicken wings and coke”, while for “a female customer in her 50s” it would suggest “porridge and soybean milk for breakfast”.</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em">Westerners would no doubt be deeply uncomfortable using this service: “Why would my gender have anything to do with what I want for lunch? What is this digital bigotry? I eat therefore I am”. We do not want to be accountable for the choices that choose us, annoying if they are wrong and invasive if they are correct.</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em">The ‘truth’ of big data and the ‘truth’ of personal anecdotes have their own separate strengths and weaknesses that point to a critical qualifying parameter of trust and information storage: That of scale. We implicitly trust the local sandwich-maker who remembers what sauce we like on our BLT, but we do not trust the KFC machine that reads our gender and tells us and its parent company what we like. The Beijing customers apparently didn’t seem to mind the typecasting and storage of their information but were quite disappointed by the inaccuracy of the suggestions. Perhaps what we really want is just as elusive to us…</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em">Tim Cowlishaw, a BBC researcher from the Internet Research Future Services (IRFS), has shown me the results of an experiment that uses the audience to filter iPlayer’s content through various ‘choice architectures’. They have found in most cases that users prefer to choose content by selecting tag words each time rather than a pre-loaded profile once. That is, ‘thriller’ instead of ‘I am 25-35 years old’. The trust we place in the algorithm is understandably very shaky - it can be unsettling that a machine that we do not control could read us as a fleshy datascape. Will we eventually become receptive to what machines can tell us about ourselves though? Could it also be helpful? A coalition could help us to see ourselves and modes of consumption more accurately.</p> 
<p style="text-indent:2em">The risk of not investigating models of co-operating with Artificial Intelligence systems is to quietly transition to an economy led by them. In an interview with Joe Rogan, Elon Musk argued that the best scenario would be to join forces - <span class="text-note" data-note="86">“if you can’t beat it, join it”</span>. The billionaire twitter-phile argued that the smart phone already considerably extends our own intelligence - and that merging with AI is a logical continuation of this process already underway. Design theorist Benjamin Bratton likes to point out that “those that harbour a fear being replaced are generally men. Feminists are much more open to the idea that we always <span class="text-note" data-note="87">already were cyborgs”</span>.</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em">An AI-orchestrated UGV news report would be part of an economy in which the transplanted camera rig would augment the role of the audience to camera shooters. They would effectively become living tripods, cumulatively forming an extensive ‘A-Eye’ to the AI. The AI would use the footage to produce various stories for various audiences depicting communal friction points of any given affair, creating sets of waves for web surfers to compete for singularity on. Delegating or surrendering the formation of these waves to an AI and letting it draw patterns and conclusions that lead to the next question we collectively ask ourselves… makes us collectively ask ourselves: Does surrendering our stories make us less human?</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em">There are many long and deeply philosophical answers to this question, but in short: No. Having a remote cognitive automaton is not the replacement of an organ but a prosthesis and a supplement to the thinking body. Fingers cannot cut apples and neither can knives but knives with fingers around them can. Bratton claims that in fact <span class="text-note" data-note="88">“we have always been posthuman”</span>, and that humanity is only properly and literally able to be defined by technology. He argues that fourth Industrial Revolution tech like applied AI do not invent but rather <span class="text-note" data-note="89">reveal more of our world</span>, demanding that we re-calibrate our assumptions of being this planet’s protagonists with intact bodies and intact histories (that is old news).</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em">To get started, a common cyborg journalist needs a rig, an excrescence of their sensing capacities and cognitive apparatuses. The camera on our smartphone might one day be considered as the prototype, an early tool used to fight misinformation, propaganda and suppression of free speech - <span class="text-note" data-note="90">#mycameraismyweapon</span>. Or not. It might be thought of by ensuing generations as overly concerned with the audiovisual. New ways for sensing and consuming news could be developed - the olfactory, hormones and emotions, air masses and soundwaves are yet to be sensed at the same scale as the cinematic.</p> 
<p style="text-indent:2em">The furore behind the proliferation of ‘fake news’ stems from the political and economic leverage it garners, and attention is being mined and monetised at the cost of accountability and truth. It could be possible that ‘fake news’ is the natural expression of an outdated economic model of media production, and that the newest tech will keep leading further into an evolution that is mostly commercial. A citizen sensing platform with an internal credit system for embedding video with product placements is rather easy to imagine. We may only live to see a constant feed of disguised adverts and an ideal terrain for astroturfing.</p> 
<p style="text-indent:2em">Such pessimism is not just unpleasant but also self-fulfilling, as commercialisation thrives on a feeling of inevitability. If the popularly perceived aim of the news report remains the delivery of information relevant to the well-being of our collective habitation, then we will continually end up disappointed. Some write that <span class="text-note" data-note="91">‘news organisations are no longer looking for truth’</span> as they witness the mechanism of stories constructed through opposition, competition and ratings in action. They are not wrong: The old profession of journalism as been hollowed out and the fields of politics and entertainment are mapped onto the same plane and attention space, promoting pathological liars, hypocrites and shock jocks.</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em">However, beyond Black Mirror episodes and other warnings of techno-capitalist clumsiness, there are many structural and functional opportunities offered by AI and automation in news that circumvent its usual machinations and provoke interesting ways ahead. What is imperative is that the right people take an interest in its development, and that moral discomfort does not discourage all but the most wolfish investors. The BBC’s Chief Technology and Product Officer has expressed the need for ‘plurality’ in current business models for media production, and reminds his audience that <span class="text-note" data-note="92">“news is [always] at the forefront of disruption”</span>. The AI news channel has many potentially disruptive qualities that are being explored on many fronts, and will probably propel itself along faster than we expect. Just so you know.</p>
