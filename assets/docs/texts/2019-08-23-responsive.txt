<p style="text-indent:0em">What would be the impact of automating news entirely by using an AI platform to organise, edit and broadcast content? And what would the roles of an automated public service broadcaster and its journalists become in this scenario?</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em">As we have already explored, the future of work at the BBC will probably consist of developing and maintaining more ‘tools’ such as UGC platforms and fact checkers that go on to congeal together. Perhaps 50 years from now the BBC is more likely to resemble an IT department than a newsroom, spending the majority of its hours engineering and maintaining tools that curate decentralised media content, rather than generating it in-house and in the field. They might also spend a decent chunk of resources gauging the impartiality of their output, both perceived and computed.</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em">The BBC is driven by ‘public purposes’ and obliged to maintain an impartial delivery of news that is not adversarial to other sources or political regimes. It is subject to the Freedom Of Information (FOI) Act, which allows anyone to enquire into its operations and practices. By taking on the inherent problematics of machine learning such as <span class="text-note" data-note="59">‘sampling bias’</span> and the <span class="text-note" data-note="60">‘black box’</span>, the BBC will likely have to pledge much of its research and development resources to the transparency of algorithms as well as to their effectiveness.</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em">“Two-thirds of U.S. adults get news from social media” reported the Pew Research Center in Washington D.C. in <span class="text-note" data-note="60">2017</span>. Social media platforms are de-facto news organisations already, and from written and linked content to endless live stream videos on Periscope, Youtube, Facebook TV, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitch, YouNow etc - they define and condense opinions. Older corporations including the BBC are aware of the shift in consumption patterns that social media usage encourages. Increasingly rare are the routines of reading newspapers in the morning and watching TV bulletins at 7 o’clock in the evening. News consumption happens at anytime of the day through phone notifications, scrolling news feeds and <span class="text-note" data-note="62">chatbots</span>. On-demand services and access to content at any time are <i>de rigueur</i>.</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em">We could easily imagine a news bulletin made up of video compilations from several streams drawing perspectives on one news story. Properly liberalised, contributors would become ‘shooters’ of a story and traditionally singular media narratives would be absent. If a large number of ‘shooters’ were incorporated, editing and framing will become the most important part of the information delivery process as it is pulled together. If the shooters have human faces, their faces are a canvas to all identities - see <span class="text-note" data-note="63">Derpfakes’ Youtube channel</span>. As their appearances will become tractable to some extent, the face canvas will move in front of the camera and become the decor to its environment, rather than as an invisible watermark behind it.</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em">The desire for a UGV news report to represent of multiple perspectives presupposes that representing multiple subjectivities at once is the closest practice to achieving something approaching objectivity (i.e. as aggregation or triangulation). The messages themselves might not necessarily be subject to polemics - because they would be too literal and too numerous - but the composition and assembly with other messages would have to become the main subject of controversy. Discussions of connotation will be primary to those around denotation, and that may be a good thing in a ‘post-truth’ era where facts are cheap. If sorting and composition is performed by an AI, then the point of contention moves even deeper into its operations and functional questions: How is it trained, on what data sets, and by whom? Should the algorithm behind this process be responsible for its methods or should it distribute responsibility evenly and collaboratively to its administrators as well?</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em">The capacity to process data almost instantly makes the use of AI inevitable in the live feed. BBC Four has recently made experiments in the real-time recomposition of mini-programs from <span class="text-note" data-note="64">archives</span>. They have used ML algorithms to sequence clips using object detection, natural language processing and frame rate analyses, and they have trained a computer on producing the <span class="text-note" data-note="65">‘most BBC 4-ish programs’</span>. The sheer speed of production has much potential in a 24-hour news cycle context where the production is rapid and the ‘freshness’ of information is <span class="text-note" data-note="66">key</span>. “News is all about speed”, a Senior Technical Operator from BBC told me. After all, ‘old news’ is a contradiction in terms, synonymous with the <i>uninteresting</i>.</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em">The desirability of being the first one to break the story in broadcasting triggers floods of rapid tweeting before facts can be verified, and equally rapid tweeting when the reports are proven <span class="text-note" data-note="67">wrong</span>. As the saying goes in 24-hour news channels, “you are never wrong for long”. Online sources take advantage of the ability to edit stories ad infinitum, which the printed word physically does not allow. The BBC, on the other hand, is a risk-averse organisation aware of the impact of premature reporting on its reputation, and the impact on ensuing events themselves. Its size and establishment hold it to higher standards of repute than fast news channels - including in the way it automates its processes. The implementation of AI however also brings hope for closing the technical time race gap for the BBC, by facilitating the checking and processing of crowdsourced information much faster. Developers might be soon talking about ‘High Frequency Fact Checking’ and the BBC could claim “never long and never wrong”.</p>
