<p style="text-indent:0em">“Fake news is nothing new”, BBC journalist Mary Hockaday claimed at the BBC Radio Theatre in <span class="text-note" data-note="29">September 2018</span>. She says that she would rather be precise by using terms like “propaganda, misinformation, suppression of free speech” instead.</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em">The foremost danger of user-generated video (UGV) platforms of course lies in their accuracy. Kyle Marimon, the CEO of a UGV start-up called <span class="text-note" data-note="30">Fresco</span> might well agree. His company developed an app for users to upload their footage and earn itemised payments when news channels cut them into their programming. Fresco’s biggest client is Fox News, which due to their much maligned <span class="text-note" data-note="31">standards of journalism</span>, raises immediate questions on how it can be possible to ensure footage is genuine and, more crucially - correctly interpreted. Footage can easily be made to fit the story, rather than the other way around.</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em">‘Fake news’, Collins ‘word’ of the year 2017, is a catch all-term for many old and new disinformation practices. Here is a rather well-made list by the <span class="text-note" data-note="32">Telegraph</span>, categorising the species of ‘fakes news’ that can be encountered today:
<blockquote> 1. Commercially-driven sensational content: not ideologically driven, but also no grounding in fact. Their key goal is to drive web traffic and, as a result, generate advertising income. Clickbait and Pop-up websites run by <span class="text-note" data-note="33">Macedonian teenagers</span> fall into this category.<br>
2. State-sponsored misinformation: Outlets in Russia, Eritrea or China might produce content to swing public opinion, sow division or give the illusion of support for a particular candidate or idea. Fabricated stories are often mixed with true or sensationalised ones. Often the aim is simply confusion and fear.<br>
3. Partisan news sites: Conflating fact and opinion, nakedly supportive of one political viewpoint or party, often positioning themselves as ‘true’ alternatives to the mainstream media. Think Breitbart and the alt-right.<br>
4. Social media: swarms of Twitter bots posting doctored or misleading photos, mass- messages on Facebook paid for by Russian intelligence outfits, conspiracy videos.<br>
5. Satire or parody: Political comedy publications such as The Onion and the Daily Mash have been around well before fake news was seen as a ‘serious’ problem.</blockquote> 
The last example demonstrates the linguistic complexity involved in written ‘fact checking’, and how a false story can have an intent of undermining critique as clear as the most earnest stories yet still can be taken very literally (as The Onion has been, in <span class="text-note" data-note="34">various cases</span>). Therefore understanding intention and context are primary to the consumption of news reports so that they can be given the attention they deserve.</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em">I believe that the de-contextualisation of stories is the most intrusive form of ‘fake news’. Not taking into account the source and ‘angle’ of information distort both the facts and relevance of news. To use a recent example, American comedian Trevor Noah found himself lumped in with Marine Le Pen, leader of the French far right Front Nationale when they both tweeted that “Africa won the world cup” after the French team’s victory in 2018.</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em">Noah later <span class="text-note" data-note="35">explained</span> that the meaning of their tweets were diametrically opposed - one being a statement about undesired African immigrants in France (which Le Pen insinuated) and the other about the pride of having African heritage while viewing a contest where wealthy nations always win out.</p> 
<p style="text-indent:2em">Interestingly Noah’s response to further criticism from the French ambassador to the USA whittled down to a fundamental disagreement between the exclusionary consequences of national heritage notations (i.e. in the USA ‘African-American’, in France just ‘Français’). This is a rich subject for discussion that emerged only from the kind of attention that talk show hosts enjoy; the kind of attention that very few non-viral topics are given in the daily feed.</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em">At this point we start to wonder if ML processes can help us in identifying contextual friction points in a much more rapid and ubiquitous way so that meaningful discussions can be streamlined into being. Most partisan news sources thrive on the lack of time and attention that most people wish to ‘spend’ on questioning their reporting. One imagines they would be somewhat neutralised if they could be indexed against other news sources in real time.</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em">In journalism, attention to context has always been of utmost importance, and traditionally is defined as the background or framing of a story. However, it also defines what is selected as news in the first place, how much of it survives the cutting table, and even how much we care to see iit in the first place. William Gibson’s theory of affordances, published in 1977, argues that we see the world through possibilities for action. Sometimes we will literally not even see what is not likely to be useful to us, and be highly attuned to that which is - food, mating and danger in his argument. Mass media taps into these affordances (the ‘human interest’ story wins out over statistics following a disaster), but shapes its output along lines, that are not concerned with direct action or the ‘universal’ human body at all. The attention economy functions much like fast food in this way, and it is difficult to ascertain if its momentum derives more from supply or demand.</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em">This is because contemporary mass media is not a platform for useful information, but for <i>interesting information</i>. Described as a new aesthetic category and “a diluted form of wonder” by <span class="text-note" data-note="36">Siane Ngai</span>, the <i>interesting</i> toggles a switch between emotional and cognitive contexts, where feeling becomes thinking and use value becomes irrelevant. According to Ngai, the <i>interesting</i> is weak, ubiquitous and <span class="text-note" data-note="37">‘always in danger of becoming profoundly boring’</span>. We couldn’t think of a better description of ‘content’, as the thumbnails at the bottom of the page compete for what next “you may be interested in”.</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em">In the hyperlink era, the graveyards of old content are able to be re-animated as a form of fluid and parametric context that is poised to be radically re-defined and re-structured at any moment. There is no reason to expect that this will have emancipatory outcomes by default (and so far the opposite seems to be true), but in the right hands it may. At the very least the <span class="text-note" data-note="38">‘freefall’</span> of context is highly revealing: News today does not seem to be a straightforward informant of a general populace, because it never was. Content has always had innumerable contexts but now they can be more easily indexed at once.</p>
