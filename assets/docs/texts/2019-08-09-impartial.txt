<p style="text-indent:0em">As new information affronts our frame of view, it is up to our discernment firstly whether to see it, then whether to believe it, then care about it, respond to it - or not. Often, we spend more of our time following ‘content’ that will probably never impact our lives then processing accrued data that probably will. We love knowing things and ‘being right’, and at the same time we love disagreeing with each other. As storytellers we are rewarded for understanding contexts alien to us, which also often serves to keep them alien. Through ‘othering’ we can build our subjectivity into a stable and efficient shape that resembles objectivity, and we create a limited world context for news to be new to.</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em">The BBC is well known for striving to be an impartial news source <span class="text-note" data-note="52">in the West</span>, but ‘impartiality’ and ‘objectivity’ are better defined in degrees rather than absolutes in the context of a government-funded organisation. The BBC is fit for purpose inside British territories but inevitably more vulnerable to criticism at an international scale. Some countries don’t hesitate to emphasize the BBC’s most minor indiscretions to diminish their global legitimacy, such as in the frequent Chinese use of BBC’s Human Planet fake treehouse <span class="text-note" data-note="53">scandal.</span></p>
<p style="text-indent:2em">Obvious questions of magnitude aside, one way of avoiding this partisan tension could be to further multiply the number of points of view on a specific news item. We could be served various sides of one story, a set chosen by us or an AI that makes explicit which value systems we are inhabiting as we flick between them. If a belief system is going to underwrite what can be true, as per <span class="text-note" data-note="54">‘the backfire effect’</span>, then shouldn’t it be declared and labelled? We could also take Facebook’s <span class="text-note" data-note="55">Fact-Checking Program</span> as a central pillar of belief. As we scroll our news feed and encounter a news item approved as ‘true’ by Facebook but with which we disagree, the interface will become our enemy by proxy and the scope of our research will narrow down to something more multiplicitous and adversarial with the platform, rather than between a handful of belligerent nation states in a crisis of sovereignty.</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em">The role and importance of investigative journalism is not reduced by the multiplication of points of view. Indeed in conflict zones and countries where free press is violently absent, distributed and data-based journalism with foreign support can often be the only option. Forensic Architecture is a research laboratory at Goldsmiths University, which produces models using the capture of mainstream technologies, such as the smartphone <span class="text-note" data-note="56">microphones and cameras</span> to triangulate the evidence of a contested event in urban space. Their techniques are viable given that most people, including in the global south, are now equipped with a mobile phone and can act as conscious or unconscious sensors of a collective spatial cognition (i.e. citizen sensing).</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em">Using citizen sensing to pursue war and criminal investigations is also demonstrated through the news platform Bellingcat, which scrapes web data and undertakes ‘online investigations’ with outsourced data <span class="text-note" data-note="57">collectors</span>. Due to their reliance on digital technologies, such practices still require a skillful mind and hand to model data and draw conclusions from it (hence ‘architecture’ in the former example), and Bellingcat even trains some of its users in basic data visualisation skills by running tutorials and workshops.</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em">The BBC has also shown an interest in using ‘amateur films’ through their investigation of the murder of two women and their children in Cameroon. By analysing recordings of the event and using simple tools like Google Maps & Facebook, BBC’s journalists were able to make a solid claim to the location, time and perpetrators of the <span class="text-note" data-note="58">crime</span>. This has enabled them to challenge the denials of involvement by protected members of the Cameroonian army.</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em">The BBC has an entire ‘monitoring division’ devoted to the analysis of foreign media and propaganda. They are primarily interested in investigating the causes and sources of misinformation abroad, including the Cameroon case above. They are also concerned with gauging how British news is being perceived in foreign countries and how foreign news is perceived by its domestic audience - for example, how Russians see Russian news. Relying on a preferred list of sources ‘on the ground’, the Monitoring team respects head office guidelines to cross-check between at least two of these sources before reporting it internally. One of the tools that they are developing with R&D is a ‘Speech to Text’ multilingual translator that helps more journalists listen to foreign language news broadcasts and hence broaden the capabilities of each investigator. In reference to the Cameroon investigation, some of their team members expressed that they weren’t so concerned with developing further tools to automate the collation of information, due to the prohibitive cost on a case-by-case basis. They instead stressed the importance of beginning with good old experience and intuition to detect something ‘wrong’ with the official line of a foreign report, and up to 20 journalists were assigned to the Cameroon case for a few days.</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em">While they do not remove the role of the experienced investigator, citizen sensing techniques and translation softwares could reduce the risks of error inherent in challenging the legitimacy of corrupted news reports from a distance. The filter bubbles that result from the reliance on a limited number of correspondents can be smoothed out by also triangulating data from many others on the ground - a hybrid practice that marries spatial forensics and reporting. As spatial modelling techniques also become more accessible, they can allow a more complete mapping of the space that ‘news’ occurs in and augment the physical reach of investigative journalism as a result.</p>
